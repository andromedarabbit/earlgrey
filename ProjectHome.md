Attention! This is an experimental project.

Earlgrey project has begun its history at April, 2009. Every co-founder, gwkang, initialjk, joe.joey, banyaji, and plaintext once worked together to build a 3D social network service and deliver a great value to every user in the CyWorld, which was one of the most famous SNSs. We still continue this effort.

Earlgrey will provide basic functionalities and extensible architecture needed to build high performing, still solid online game servers.

# Components #
## Engine ##
Although the main purpose of Earlgrey project is providing a solid online game server engine, it is still under hard work. The engine is premature and is not primary concern for this documentation.

## Build Tools ##
Earlgrey has useful and mature build tools. You can use it just like us. We are building our engine with our own build tools. A few companies actually are using our build tools for their projects.

### Earlgrey.UnityBuild ###
UnityBuild makes sure build time should be cut in a half. If you are Visual C++ developer, then just try it!

### MSBuild.Earlgrey.Tasks ###
Custom extension is provided for supplementing basic functionalities of MSBuild. MSBuild.Earlgrey.Tasks is especially designed for making up for the alternative open source extension [MSBuild Community Tasks](http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/). In fact, MSBuild Community Tasks is essential part of MSBuild.Earlgrey.Tasks and deployed with it.
