This is the Developer's Kit package for DotNetZip v1.9.  This package was packed Thu-02-25-2010-222909.78.  In this zip you will find Debug and Release DLLs for the various versions of the Ionic.Zip class library and the Ionic.Zlib class library.  There is a separate top-level folder for each distinct version of the DLL, and within those top-level folders there are Debug and Release folders.  In the Debug folders you will find a DLL, a PDB, and an XML file for the given library, while the Release folder will have just a DLL.  The DLL is the actual library (either Debug or Release flavor), the PDB is the debug information, and the XML file is the intellisense doc for use within Visual Studio.  There is also a .chm file, which is a viewable help file.  In addition you will find the MSI file for the VS2008-integrated help.
